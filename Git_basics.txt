GIT --Git means a distributed version control system used to track changes in files, especially source code, 
	allowing multiple developers to collaborate on projects efficiently. It enables tracking changes, 
	creating branches for parallel development, and managing different versions of code over time.

Remote Repository
A remote repository is a version of your project that is hosted on the internet or another network. 
It allows multiple collaborators to work together and share changes. Common platforms include GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket.

Local Repository
A local repository is a version of your project that exists on your personal machine. 
It contains all the project's files, history, and branches, allowing you to work offline and commit changes locally.

Staging Area
The staging area (or index) is where you prepare changes before committing them to your local repository.
You can selectively choose which changes to include in your next commit, allowing for more granular control over your projectâ€™s history.

Working Directory
The working directory is the current state of your project files on your local machine.
It includes all the files you are currently editing and reflects the latest changes made.
You can think of it as the "live" version of your project where you make modifications.

GitHub is a web-based interface that uses Git, the open source version control software that lets multiple people
 	make separate changes to web pages at the same time. As Carpenter notes, because it allows for real-time collaboration,
 	GitHub encourages teams to work together to build and edit their site content.

What is GitHub used for? GitHub allows you to create, store, change, merge, and collaborate on files or code.
	Any team member can access the GitHub repository (think of this as a folder for files) and see the most recent version in real time.
	Then, they can make edits or changes that the other collaborators also see
